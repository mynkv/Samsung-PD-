## Day-1-Introduction to RTL and Synthesis

Let us first discuss several terms:

RTL : RTL stnds for register transistor level. It is the implementation of the specifications of the design.

Iverilog : Icarus Verilog is an implementation of the Verilog hardware description language compiler that generates netlists in the desired format.

Design : It is a set of verilog codes, which meets the given specifications. Design may have one or more primary inputs and outputs.

Testbench : Testbench is a code module that describes the stimulus to a logic design and checks whether the design's outputs match its specification. Testbench does not have primay inpur or output.

Simulator : Simultor is a tool used to check adherence of RTL to specifications. It looks for changes in the input and correspondingly output. Following image shows the working of the simulator

<img width="1085" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/6ede0c2a3604a48c1a2c22a82f43d898a15e064f/simulator.png">

 <details>
 <summary>Environment Setup</summary>

Environment Setup includes tool flow setup and file setup. For setting up the environment import the library files and verilog files into your directory from github. Command to do so is : **git clone link.git**. Below screenshot shows the cloning of directories from github, and the files inside the directories. Command to view files inside directories is : **ls**. <br>

<img width="1085" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/3e0dc7fffa135b027e14a3d91350622731803ce3/Cloning%20git.PNG">

In the image above we can see the files inside the directories "vsdflow" and "sky130RTLDesignANDSynthesisWorkshop".
</details>

 <details>
 <summary>Working with iverilog and gtkwave</summary>

Inside the folder verilog_files in the directory "sky130RTLDesignANDSynthesisWorkshop" we have all the verilog design files as well as testbenches. To lload these files into the iverilog, first change directory to verilog_files and to load files use command : **iverilog design.v tb_xyz.v**. Below image shows the all the files inside verilog_files, verilog_model.<br>
<img width="1085" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/3e0dc7fffa135b027e14a3d91350622731803ce3/files%20under%20diff%20directories.PNG">

After **iverilog design.v tb_xyz.v** command a.out executable file is created which is used to dump the output into the vcd file. Now execute a.out by command : **./a.out**, after this a vcd file is created. Open the vcd file in gtkwave by using the following command : gtkwave **name.vcd**. Below image shows the execution for good_mux design file and its testbench.<br>

 <summary>Introduction to Yosys</summary>

Yosys is the synthesizer used to convert the RTL into the netlist. Netlist is the representation of the design in the form of the cells from library. Below figure shows the flow for the yosys synthesizer.<br>
<img width="1085" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/2b0dee97319264489ff2f5620d28c60efd2e4964/yosys_Setup.PNG">

 To verify the synthesis same testbench is given along with the netlist to observe the funtionality of the design.<br>

The . lib (library) file contains important information about the electrical behavior of the standard cells used in the IC design. It includes data such as cell timing models, power characteristics, voltage thresholds, and other parameters necessary for accurate timing analysis. 
In the library we have fast cells to meet the setup time constraing and slow cells to meet up the hold time constraint.

 <summary>Yosys</summary>
	
Steps in the yosys are as follows :
	
1. Yosys is the synthesizer we are using. Command to invoke yosys is : **yosys**.<br>
2. Inside yosys, first we need to read the library file. Command to read the library file is : **read_liberty -lib ../path_where_library_is**.<br>
3. Now read the verilog file by using the command : **read_verilog file_name.v**.<br>
4. After this we need to specify the module for synthesis by using command : **synth -top file_name**.<br>
5. Now we move on to generating the netlist. Command to generate the netlist is : **abc -liberty ../path**. Path we specifies is the library path for the library which we want to use. This also gives the report about the design such as number of i/p and o/p ext. Below image shows the report for the design good_mux.<br>
<img width="400" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/95aaab7969f9daedac9753f19158df9484d434e0/info_design.PNG"><br>
6. To see the graphical representation of the design, we give command : **show**. Below figure shows the graphical representation of good_mux.<br>
<img width="800" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/0916fd2212262c81d86e6af8d7ec4a9186f6b9d6/design_graphical.PNG">.<br>
7. To write the netlist we give command : **write_verilog filename_netlist.v**.<br>
8. Now to see the generated netlist we use command : **!vim filename_netlist.v**. Below figure shows the generated netlist for a latch.<br>
<img width="400" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/0916fd2212262c81d86e6af8d7ec4a9186f6b9d6/netlist.jpeg">.<br>

## Day-2-synthesis-FFcoding-styles

The library file contains the definitions of all the available standard cells for a particular technology and is used for RTL to gate level conversion. In other words it is the cells that the synthesizer is allowed to use for conversion. The library which we are using is **sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80**, here: <br>
1. tt - Typical Library
2. 025C - Temperature
3. 1v80 - Voltage
Command to open lib file is: **vim path-of_lib**. PVT (Process, Voltage, Temperature) determines how our silicon is going to work i.e. fast, slow or typical.

 <summary>Comparison of different cells of same gate.</summary><br>
The provided image illustrates a comparison between 3 different configurations of 2-input AND gates. It's evident that when the gate's physical size is enlarged, its performance improves; however, this enhancement comes at the expense of increased production costs. Consequently, a comprehensive design library encompasses a spectrum of cell types, spanning from high-speed to slower variants. Invariably, there exists a delicate balance between the occupied area and the operational efficiency of these cells.<br><br>

 <summary>Hierarchial and Flat Netlist</summary><br>
**Hirarchial Netlist** <br>
A hierarchical level netlist refers to a structured representation of a digital circuit's connectivity and components, organized in a hierarchical manner. In this approach, the circuit is broken down into smaller functional blocks, which are then represented as modules or subcircuits. Each module encapsulates its internal logic and connectivity, which is connected to other modules through defined input and output ports.<br>
In a hierarchical level netlist, each module has its own associated netlist, which details the interconnections of its internal components. The top-level netlist connects the various modules and their respective input and output ports. <br>
Let us consider a design with 2 modules, deatils of those two modules is as shown in fig below.<br><br>
<img width="1085" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/268e117f68eff72b7fc2649fcad4b7e756aada1d/2_multipleodules.png">

Regarding the design comprised of two modules, the images below depict both its visual representation in graphical form and its netlist structured in a hierarchical manner.<br><br>														
	<img width="1085" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/268e117f68eff72b7fc2649fcad4b7e756aada1d/Samsung_PD_%23day0/3_gui_multiple_module.PNG">					<img width="600" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/268e117f68eff72b7fc2649fcad4b7e756aada1d/Samsung_PD_%23day0/3_netlist_hier.PNG"><br><br>

 
**Flatten Netlist**<br>
A flattened netlist refers to a representation of a digital circuit where all hierarchical levels have been removed, and the entire design is presented as a single, monolithic netlist. In contrast to a hierarchical netlist, which maintains the modular structure of a design, a flattened netlist combines all modules and subcircuits into a single interconnected network of gates, flip-flops, and other components.
For the above design of two modules, the images below depict both its visual representation in graphical form and its netlist structured in a flattened manner..<br><br>

<img width="1085" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/268e117f68eff72b7fc2649fcad4b7e756aada1d/Samsung_PD_%23day0/3_gui_flat.PNG">					               <img width="600" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/268e117f68eff72b7fc2649fcad4b7e756aada1d/Samsung_PD_%23day0/3_netlist_flat1.PNG">

 <summary>Why sub module level design.</summary><br>

Hierarchical netlists are preferred over flattened netlists due to several advantages they offer in managing the complexity of modern digital circuit designs:<br><br>

1. Modularity and Abstraction: Hierarchical netlists allow the design to be organized into separate functional modules. Each module encapsulates a specific functionality, leading to a clearer understanding of the overall system. This modularity enables abstraction, where engineers can work on individual modules without being overwhelmed by the entire design.<br><br>

2. Ease of Design and Collaboration: Hierarchical netlists promote efficient teamwork. Engineers can work concurrently on different modules without conflicting with each other's work. This separation also enables the reuse of well-tested modules in various projects, saving time and effort.<br><br>

3. Simpler Debugging and Verification: When a problem arises, hierarchical netlists allow engineers to isolate and debug issues within specific modules. This targeted approach simplifies the debugging process, as opposed to searching through a single flattened netlist for errors.<br><br>

4. Performance Optimization: Synthesis tools can more effectively optimize hierarchical netlists, as they have a clearer understanding of module boundaries. This can result in improved performance, area utilization, and power efficiency.<br><br>

5. Simulation Efficiency: Hierarchical netlists allow for efficient simulation by focusing simulations on specific modules instead of the entire design. This speeds up verification and reduces simulation complexity.<br><br>

6. Maintainability and Scalability: As designs evolve and scale, maintaining a hierarchical structure remains manageable. Adding new modules or modifying existing ones is easier, and the overall design remains comprehensible.<br><br>

To see the netlist or the gui of a submodule in the design, command for synthesis is: **synth -top module_name**. Below image shows the graphical illustration of the sub module1. <br>

<img width="1085" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/887a9469e03cc4cd92f3b6cf902c2179de9a498e/Samsung_PD_%23day0/3_sub_module.PNG"><br><br>

 <summary>D-Flip Flops and their coding styles</summary><br>

A flip-flop is a fundamental digital electronic circuit component used to store binary information. It serves as a basic building block for memory elements and sequential logic circuits in digital systems. Flip-flops are designed to retain their state until a specific signal triggers a change, making them crucial for storing data and creating time-dependent operations in digital circuits.<br>
Glitches can emerge due to the presence of combinational circuits within a design. To mitigate the propagation of these glitches into subsequent combinational circuits, a strategic approach involves introducing flip-flops between the initial combinational circuit and its output. Various coding styles for the flops are discussed below.<br><br>

command to specify library in case of D-FF: **dfflibmap -liberty library_path**.<br><br>
<details>
 <summary>Asynchronous Set</summary><br>

An asynchronous set in a flip-flop allows you to directly set the output of the flip-flop to a specific state regardless of the clock signal. When the asynchronous set input is activated, typically by asserting a specific signal (e.g., pulling it high), the flip-flop's output will immediately transition to the set state, regardless of the clock cycle. This feature can be useful in certain scenarios where you need to ensure a particular starting state for the flip-flop, regardless of the clock timing.<br><br>

</details>

<details>
 <summary>Synchronous reset</summary><br>

Synchronous reset enables controlled and synchronized resetting of the circuit's state based on the clock signal. Unlike asynchronous reset, where the reset signal can affect the circuit output at any time, synchronous reset ensures that the reset operation occurs only at a specific clock edge. In synchronous reset, a dedicated reset signal is provided to the flip-flop or sequential circuit. However, this reset signal is synchronized with the clock signal. The circuit's state is only changed to the reset state when the clock signal transitions (either rising edge or falling edge), ensuring that the reset operation happens predictably within the clock cycle.<br><br>

Coding of DFF with Synchronous reset:<br>
<img width="1085" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/887a9469e03cc4cd92f3b6cf902c2179de9a498e/Samsung_PD_%23day0/4_dff_sync.PNG"><br>

3. Multiplication by 4: Shift the binary number 2 bit left, and pu "0" at the LSB and 'LSB + 1'.

<details>
 <summary>Special Case</summary><br>
 Let us consider a 3 bit number a = {a[2], a[1], a[0]}.<br>
 Suppose we need to find 9a. <br>
 so, 9a = 8a + a ;<br>
 9a = {a[2], a[1], a[0], a[2], a[1], a[0]}<br>

 Below image shows thegraphical representation of multiplier by 9:<br>
   <img width="600" alt="[icc2_shell" src="https://github.com/mynkv/Samsung-PD-/blob/0f1af4e8178810f113fef96c397925b1e0c2a421/gui_mult_8.png"><br>

 So for this kind of assignment there is no cell generated. Hence the need of multiplier is eliminated.<br>

## Day-2-Logic-Optimization

Combinational logic optimization is a process used in digital circuit design to improve the efficiency, speed, and overall performance of digital circuits. Combinational logic refers to logic circuits where the outputs depend solely on the current inputs, with no memory or feedback elements. The goal of optimization is to minimize the complexity of the logic circuit while maintaining the desired functionality. Techniques to optimise combinational circuits are: <br><br>
1. Constant Propagation.
2. Boolean logic optimization.

<details>
<summary>Examples of Combinational Logic</summary>
	
<details>
<summary>Example for constant propagation</summary><br>
	
 Let us consider an exression: Y = (A.B + C)<br>
	In the original expression one AND gate and one NOR gate is used.<br>
 If A is grounded in the above expression then: Y = C'<br>
 	Now only one NOT gate is used.<br>
So, both area and speed of operation is improved.<br>
 	
</details>

<details>
<summary> Example for Boolean logic optimization </summary> <br>
	
 Let us consider an exression: Y = a ? (b ? c:(c ? a:0)):(!c) <br>
	Y = a'c' + a.(b'ac + bc) <br>
 	  = a'c' + ab'c + abc <br>
	  = a'c' + ac <br>
   	  = a ex_nor b
