 <summary>dc_shell </summary>
Design Compiler is the command line interface of Synopsys synthesis tool and is invoked by either typing dc_shell in a UNIX shell. The dc_shell is the original format that is based on Synopsys's own language while dc_shell-t uses the standard Tcl language.
Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch of dc_shell:
